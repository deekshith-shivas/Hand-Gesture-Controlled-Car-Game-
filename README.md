# ✋ Hand Gesture Controlled Car Game 🚗💨

A fun and interactive **computer vision–based game** that allows you to **control a car using hand gestures** — no keyboard required!  
Built using **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**, this project blends AI and gaming into one cool experience. 🧠🎮

---

## 🧠 Concept

This project detects hand gestures using your webcam.  
- Move your **right hand** forward ➡️ car moves ahead  
- Move your **left hand** forward ➡️ car brakes or reverses  
- Raise both hands ✋✋ to stop or reset  

The camera captures your gestures, and the Python script translates them into keyboard signals — controlling the on-screen car.
